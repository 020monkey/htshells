HTSHELLS - Self contained .htaccess web "shells"
Pick the one you need and rename it to .htaccess and upload it.

Some notes on the shells
- htaccess.cgi

- htaccess.php

- htaccess.ssi

- htaccess.server-info
  This is not a genuine shell, but rather a self contained information disclosure attack

- htaccess.server-status
  This is not a genuine shell, but rather a self contained information disclosure attack
