HTSHELLS - Self contained .htaccess web "shells"
Pick the one you need and rename it to .htaccess and upload it.

Some notes on the shells
- htaccess.php
  PHP based web shell access via http://domain/path/.htaccess

- htaccess.ssi
  Server Side Include based web shell, access via http://domain/path/.htaccess

- htaccess.server-info
  Server info binding for Apache
  This is not a genuine shell, but rather a self contained information disclosure attack

- htaccess.server-status
  Server status binding for Apache
  This is not a genuine shell, but rather a self contained information disclosure attack

- htaccess.caucho-stats
  Server status binding for the mod_caucho Resin java server module
  This is not a genuine shell, but rather a self contained information disclosure attack
